                    <p>My name is Chan Kwang Yung, I am currently a first-year degree student studying in Computer Science. I am single, and soon-to-be 19 years old. I come from a more rural part of Kuching called Siburan. It is approximately 27 km away from Swinburne and driving from here to there has become my daily commute. I have many interests in the artistic side of life such as drawing, fashion, and music. My hobbies include drawing, playing computer games and listening to music. I particularly like K-pop above all else at the moment. A few of my favourite songs include Spring day, Way Back Home and Bbibbi.</p>
